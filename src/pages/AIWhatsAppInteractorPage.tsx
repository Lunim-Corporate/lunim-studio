For independent professionals and small businesses, WhatsApp is a primary client communication channel. However, managing the constant flow of messages manually was leading to significant business challenges. The team needed a solution to:
              <br />
              <br />
- Eliminate slow response times and missed messages
              <br />
- Prevent lost business opportunities due to delayed replies
                <br />
- Streamline the disorganised and time-consuming manual booking process
                <br />
- Provide 24/7 customer service without being tied to a phone

              We developed an AI-powered WhatsApp agent that acts as a real-time assistant, automating conversations and managing client interactions. Key features include:
              <br />
              <br />
              - Automated Appointment Booking: The agent intelligently captures necessary booking details, such as service type, preferred time/date, location and contact information.
              <br />
              - Instant FAQ Answering: Responds to common inquiries such as availability, services offered, working hours, and more.

              <br />
              - 24/7 Availability: The assistant operates around the clock, ensuring every customer inquiry receives an instant, professional response.
              <br />
              - Follow-Ups & Reminders: Automatically follows up with leads who havenâ€™t responded and sends appointment reminders when needed.
